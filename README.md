# ActiveSG pgbench

## Conclusions

Errors happen when all of the following conditions are met:

- querying through RDS Proxy
- with `--client` of more than what the proxy is allowed to make into the RDS cluster (50% more to make it very replicable), to force multiplexing on the proxy
- with `--protocol` of `prepared`, to use PostgreSQL extended query protocol

The errors in particular are:

```plaintext
ERROR:  portal "" does not exist
ERROR:  prepared statement "P_0" already exists
```

Which indicate that connections are sometimes mixed up by RDS Proxy when serving queries.

## Methodology

Tests are run against an Aurora PostgreSQL 15.6 regional cluster, with 1 * `db.t4g.medium` instance (max 394 connections allowed). The RDS Proxy is set up to take up to 100% of available DB connections (also 394).

`pgbench` is used to send `select-1.sql` (just `SELECT 1;`) repeatedly to the DB. That is the full test.

![Architecture](./architecture.png)

### ‚ùå Run with proxy on, high `--client`, `--protocol` of `prepared`, which causes errors

This is very replicable. More than 20 runs were made, a different number of errors appeared in every single one of them, at different stages of the runs.

üí° `--client` of 600 is chosen since 600 is 50% more than the max connection allowed on the DB instance itself (394 max conn), which forces proxy level multiplexing to happen, and triggers errors. Using too many more (e.g. 1000) makes borrowing connections too slow and the `pgbench` can never finish. Using only slightly more connections than the instance's max conn (e.g. 400, which is 6 more than 394) rarely triggers the errors since multiplexing doesn't happen frequently enough. `--protocol` of `prepared` instructs `pgbench` to use PostgreSQL extended query protocol. `--protocol` also supports `simple` which queries without the `prepare` statements.

For the other variables, `--jobs=10` means 10 threads which matches the no. of cores of the testing laptop, so it doesn't really matter. `--rate=100000` and `--time=20` just makes sure the test runs for 20 seconds at the maximum RPS possible.

The above errors indicate that multiplexing did not work properly during the run.

The next 3 examples will eliminate the variables one-by-one:

### ‚ùå Run with **proxy off**, high `--client`, `--protocol` of `prepared`, which fails as expected

‚ö†Ô∏è must make sure there is no existing connections on the DB before the run since the script consumes almost 100% of DB connections -> go to the instance, click `actions` -> `reboot`

The only difference is the `PGHOST`, which points to the cluster endpoint now. Notice the failures come directly from connection acquisition, since the run will need 600 connection which is more than the max no. of connections allowed:

Lowering the `--client` (to 380 in this case) does work:

Basically, with proxy off, when trying to acquire more connections than possible, connection acquisition errors are thrown and the runs are aborted, which is the expected behavior.

### ‚úÖ Run with proxy on, **low enough `--client`**, `--protocol` of `prepared`, which passes

üí° `--client` of 394 is chosen to match the max conn allowed on the instance. Notice that technically some connections are still reused since RDS Proxy and Performance Insights etc. make a handful of connections to the DB all the time, reducing the usable connections to ~385. However, from testing, this tiny difference doesn't matter.

### ‚úÖ Run with proxy on, high `--client`, **`--protocol` of `simple`**, which passes

This is the proof that multiplexing **does** work. It only has problems when extended query protocol is used.

### Conclusions

With all the experiments put together:

- ‚ùå Run with proxy on, high `--client`, `--protocol` of `prepared`, which causes errors
- ‚ùå Run with **proxy off**, high `--client`, `--protocol` of `prepared`, which fails as expected
- ‚úÖ Run with proxy on, **low enough `--client`**, `--protocol` of `prepared`, which passes
- ‚úÖ Run with proxy on, high `--client`, **`--protocol` of `simple`**, which passes

We can conclude that "proxy on, high `--client`, `--protocol` of `prepared`" are the 3 elements that causes multiplexing problems. Please go back to the start of this document to read the conclusions again.
